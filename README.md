Cheat Mugs
==========

A gift for your geek friend.

This is a collection of cheat sheet images suitable for coffee mugs.
Currently it contains images for:

- [tmux](tmux/tmux.pdf)
- [python](python/python.pdf)

You have two options here:

1. Get these images to a local shop that can print images directly on coffee mugs
2. Print these on stickers and put them on an existing coffee mug

Below are samples of what it looks like in the end:
